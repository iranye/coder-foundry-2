MediaManager.WPF

TODO:
    Be able to open this file from the client
	Create JSON file options (for each flattened MP3 directory, create a separate JSON):
		PROS:
            Manage user-specific preferences (i.e., user logs in to client)
			Be able to create m3u playlists on the fly using deserialized JSON
			May be possible to keep a directory structure in a JSON
			May be able to maintain a list of tags within each JSON
			Store more info than can be put into m3u files
			May be able to handle wide characters better (than having to maintain separate vlc-generated playlists)
			Allows assigning a quality value rather than just deleting from m3u
		CONS:			
			More files to have to maintain
			JSON file easy to get out of sync (may be able to update JSON when using FileMaze to move, delete, add files)
	FIX:
		

	On Click-to-AddPlaylist-to-Volume, check if already included (in other M3u)
	Create M3U (for CWD)
	Make FolderFilter lookup async (resolve multiple recursive calls)
	Hide Leafs that are already included (Checkbox)
	Fix issue New Item/name-change not updating in Nav pane

	Add/Remove where applicable:
		FileEntry
		(FileEntryVewModel)
		Folder
		FolderViewModel

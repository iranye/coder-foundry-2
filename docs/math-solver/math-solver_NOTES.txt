Attempt to find solution via serial operations.

If none found, get prime factorization then attempt to find factors that will solve.

Solved via Serial Operations:
273:[5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 20]
20 + 11 = 31
31 + 8 = 39
39 * 7 = 273

Solved via Serial Operations + Right-Precedent Operation (Prime Factorization: 335 = 5 â€¢ 67):
335:[4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 20]
8 * 7 = 56
56 + 11 = 67
20 / 4 = 5
67 * 5 = 335

-- 5 --
463: [9, 11, 13, 19, 20, 25]
20 * 25 = 500
13 - 11 = 2
2 * 9 = 18
19 + 18 = 37
500 - 37 = 463

(463 is Prime, so solution is to find one or more products then add or subtract until solution is found
[500, 37]: [9, 11, 13, 19]
